# Module 3.3: Integrating MongoDB with Node.js

## Initializing Project
- Create an empty directory and initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
- Install necessary packages such as Mongoose, Dotenv, and Nodemon using `npm install`.

## Setting Up MongoDB Connection with Mongoose
- Use Mongoose to establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
- Store the MongoDB connection URL in the `.env` file for security.

## CRUD with MongoDB and Node.js
### Routes
- Create a folder named `routes` and define the API routes in `routes.js`.
- Implement the HTTP methods (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.

### Model
- Create a folder named `models` and define a Mongoose schema for the MongoDB collection.
- Export the Mongoose model based on the defined schema.

### Creating a New Document
- Implement a route for creating a new document in the MongoDB collection.
- Use the Mongoose model to save the document to the database.

### Reading All Documents
- Implement a route for fetching all documents from the MongoDB collection.
- Use the Mongoose model to query the database and retrieve all documents.

### Reading a Single Document by ID
- Implement a route for fetching a specific document by its ID from the MongoDB collection.
- Use the Mongoose model to query the database and find the document by ID.

### Updating a Document
- Implement a route for updating a specific document by its ID in the MongoDB collection.
- Use the Mongoose model to query the database and update the document.

### Deleting a Document
- Implement a route for deleting a specific document by its ID from the MongoDB collection.
- Use the Mongoose model to query the database and remove the document.

## Transactions in MongoDB
- Define transactions as logical units of processing that include one or more database operations.
- Explore ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and their significance in transactions.
- Understand how MongoDB ensures ACID compliance for distributed transactions across replica sets and shards.

## Example of MongoDB Transaction with JavaScript
- Implement a sample JavaScript code snippet to demonstrate a MongoDB transaction.
- Showcase the usage of `session` objects for starting, committing, and aborting transactions.
- Highlight how transactions ensure that all operations either succeed or fail as a whole.

By completing Module 3.3, you have gained a solid understanding of integrating MongoDB with Node.js, implementing CRUD operations, and handling transactions using Mongoose and MongoDB's ACID-compliant distributed database. This knowledge will enable you to build scalable and robust applications that interact with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
